# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview of Project
Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform that has been growing and needs to move all their accessible data from a large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database.  By doing so the analytics team will be able to perform more enhanced and efficient analysis while also being able to create reports for company stakeholders and individuals who donate funding to projects.  I have been assigned to work with a junior SQL developer to assist in extracting and transforming the data from the large Excel file into four separate CSV files, create a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD, loading the CSV files into the database and performing SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders.  While working on this project I will learn how to apply the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process, which are the three steps data engineers use when collecting, cleaning, and storing data in a database prior to performing analysis. I will use Python and Pandas to perform the extract and transform steps. Then, Iâ€™ll create a PostgreSQL database and table schemas by using an entity relationship diagram (ERD), and load the data into the database. Finally, I will use SQL to perform data analysis.
